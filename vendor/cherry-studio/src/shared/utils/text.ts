/**
 * Adjust a UTF-16 slice boundary so it never falls between the two halves of a
 * surrogate pair. `slice(0, index)` with the returned value keeps astral
 * characters (emoji, extended CJK) whole instead of emitting a lone surrogate,
 * which chat APIs reject or render as a replacement character.
 *
 * Use this when a caller must keep an existing UTF-16 code-unit boundary: it
 * adjusts that boundary in place without shifting the budget to code points.
 * For a one-shot display truncation where the cap is soft, a code-point view
 * such as `[...text].slice(0, max).join('')` reads cleaner and is just as correct.
